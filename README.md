# taggart
The boastful mp3 tag scripting tool

## Status

This project is currently in its most basic iteration, allowing for the viewing of ID3v2 tags in MP3 files. Even this functionality is incomplete.

The eventual goal is to support both ID3v2 and ID3v1/1.1 tagging formats, for both read and write ability, across many different file formats, however this will be a slow process.
